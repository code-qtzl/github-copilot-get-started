## How to Run

Since this is a vanilla JavaScript application using ES modules and fetching external APIs, it requires a local web server to run correctly (opening `index.html` directly in the browser will not work due to CORS policies).

### Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx` to run a lightweight server without installing dependencies:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Testing

2. Run tests:
